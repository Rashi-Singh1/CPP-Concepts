Simple graph : a graph having no self loop or multi edges

	max no of edges :								//for simple graph
		undirected edges : n(n-1)/2
		directed edges : n(n-1)
			where n is no of vertices

	I.E.  for dense graph no of edges = O(n^2)

Better use :

		   adjacency matrix for dense graph
		   adjacenecy list for sparse graph

Simple Path/ Path : no vertices or edge is repeated
Trail : no edge is repeated but vertex can be repeated like : 
		

		1<------(2)------->3
